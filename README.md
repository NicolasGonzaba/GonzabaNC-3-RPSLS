Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Full

I designed a full website hosted on Azure, that allows the user to play a game of rock paper scissors lizard Spock. It gets data from a back end API that gives an answer based on user inputs, and decides CPU choices in VS CPU mode

Peer Review: Vanessa Acuna - The website works for me and it met all the requirements. The link also work for me. Good Job!
